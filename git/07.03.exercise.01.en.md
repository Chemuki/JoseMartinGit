* **title:** The Chronicle of the Lost Code 🗺️🔍

**Greetings, brave code archaeologists!** In today's excavation, you will face the challenge of discovering and documenting the "Lost Code of the Ancient Web Application." Your mission is to implement a new feature and, most importantly, record your feat with a clear and descriptive commit message. Grasp your development tools, for the adventure is about to begin!

#### Step 1: Preparing the Expedition 🏺

Before venturing into the code ruins, you need to establish your base camp (create a new Git repository):

```bash
mkdir code-ruins
cd code-ruins
git init
```

#### Step 2: Discovery of the First Fragment 📜

Your first task is to uncover a fragment of the "Lost Code." You will create a file called `treasure.html` and add a simple HTML skeleton:

```html
<!-- treasure.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Treasure Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>🏴‍☠️ The Treasure of the Ancient Web Application 🏴‍☠️</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

```bash
git add treasure.html
```

#### Step 3: The Chronicle of Discovery 🖋️

Now, document your discovery with a commit message that follows the learned best practices. Remember, you should be clear, concise, and descriptive:

```bash
git commit -m "Add basic HTML skeleton for treasure.html

This commit introduces the treasure.html file, marking the beginning of our adventure to rebuild the Ancient Web Application. The HTML skeleton will serve as the foundation upon which we will reconstruct the lost mysteries of the ancient code."
```

#### Step 4: Revealing the Secret of the Lost Code 🗝️

With the HTML skeleton in place, it's time to reveal a hidden secret in the code. You will add a secret JavaScript functionality inside `treasure.html`:

```html
<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', (event) => {
        alert('You have discovered the secret of the Treasure of the Ancient Web Application!');
    });
</script>
```

Once again, prepare and document your finding:

```bash
git add treasure.html
git commit -m "Integrate secret functionality into treasure.html

A JavaScript script has been added that triggers an alert when the page loads.
This easter egg reveals the secret of the Treasure of the Ancient Web Application, adding an
element of mystery and adventure to the user experience."
```

#### 🤔 Conclusion

Congratulations, skilled code explorers! You have not only discovered the secrets of the "Lost Code of the Ancient Web Application" but also learned the importance of documenting each step of your adventure with clear and descriptive commit messages.

May your future code chronicles always be as detailed and revealing as today's. Until the next excavation in the code ruins!
