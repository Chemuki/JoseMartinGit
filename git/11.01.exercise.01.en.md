* **title:** Taming Digital Giants with Git LFS 🐉📦

**Greetings, brave tamers of digital giants!** In this exercise, you will become masters of the ancient art of Git LFS, learning to tame the giants (large files) that inhabit your code kingdom. Armed with knowledge and your command sword (terminal), you will embark on the noble task of ensuring that these colossi do not hinder the agility of your repository. Let's dive in!

#### Step 1: Summoning Git LFS to Your Land (Installation) 🧙‍♂️

Before you can face any giant, you need the magical artifact Git LFS. Open your spellbook of commands (terminal) and recite the invocation spell:

```bash
git lfs install
```

With this spell, you have enabled Git LFS on your machine. You will see a message confirming that the "Hook" has been installed.

#### Step 2: Choose Your Giant (Tracking Files with Git LFS) 🐲

In your code kingdom, decide which giant you want to tame first. For this exercise, let's focus on dragon images in PNG format, famous for their size and beauty.

In the heart of your kingdom (repository), utter the incantation to begin tracking these creatures:

```bash
git lfs track "*.png"
```

This spell will modify the `.gitattributes` file, adding a record of your intention to track PNGs with Git LFS.

#### Step 3: Capturing the Giant (Add and Commit) 🗡️

Now that you have decided which giant to capture, it's time to trap it. Place a PNG image in your repository, as if you were adding a treasure to the kingdom's treasure:

```bash
# Make sure you have a PNG image named dragon.png
git add dragon.png
```

With the giant in your trap, seal its fate with a commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Capture a majestic image of a dragon with Git LFS"
```

#### Step 4: Sending the Giant to Its New Home (Push) 🌌

With the dragon now safely within the confines of your commit, it's time to send it to the distant lands of the remote repository, where it can rest without disturbing the peace of the kingdom:

```bash
git push origin main
```

Watch as Git LFS takes care of this mythical being, ensuring that its size does not hinder the travels of other explorers in your kingdom (other collaborators).

#### 🤔 Conclusion

You have shown great courage and wisdom in taming your first digital giant with Git LFS. Your code kingdom will greatly benefit from your ability to handle large files with such grace and efficiency.
