* **title:** The Great Search for the Royal Seal - Sign Commits and Tags with GPG üè∞üîè

**Oh, brave knights and ladies of the Kingdom of Code!** The time has come to undertake a noble quest: learn to sign your commits and tags with the magic of GPG, sealing your creations with the royal seal of your digital identity . This feat will ensure that your messages in the sacred scroll of Git (your repository) are authentic and have not been altered by malicious wizards. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®

#### Preparations for the Search üìú‚ú®

Before you can begin your adventure, you must make sure you have the GPG installed on your system. In the lands of Unix (Linux/Mac), summon your terminal and say:

```bash
gpg --version
```

If you do not already have this magical artifact, consult the elders (your distribution's documentation or the GPG website) for instructions on how to acquire it.

#### Step 1: Forge Your Royal Key üóùÔ∏è

Every great monarch needs a unique seal. Generate your GPG key with the following enchantment:

```bash
gpg --full-generate-key
```

Follow the instructions to select the type of key, its size, and the duration of its validity. Make sure you provide your real name and email address, as they will be linked to your label.

#### Step 2: Teach the Sacred Scroll (Git) your Seal üìñüîè

Once your key is forged, you must inform the sacred scroll (Git) of the existence of your royal seal. List your available keys and take note of the ID of the key you just created:

```bash
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format LONG
```

Configure Git to use your real seal when signing jobs:

```bash
git config --global user.signingkey YOUR_KEY_ID
```

#### Step 3: The First Signing of the Parchment üñãÔ∏è

Now that everything is in place, it's time to seal your first commit. Make a small modification to the Code Realm (your repository) and prepare your change for commit:

```bash
echo "For the glory of the Code Kingdom!" > greeting_real.txt
git add greeting_real.txt
```

Sign your commit with your royal seal:

```bash
git commit -S -m "I add royal greetings to the Kingdom of Code"
```

#### Step 4: Verify the Authenticity of the Seal üõ°Ô∏è

To confirm that your signature is true and that the commit has been correctly stamped with your real seal, use:

```bash
git log --show-signature
```

#### ü§î Conclusion

You have successfully completed your quest, sealing your works with the authenticity of your royal seal and ensuring that the Kingdom of the Code remains protected and authentic through the ages. Use your new ability wisely and fairly, and may your commits always reflect the truth of your intentions.
