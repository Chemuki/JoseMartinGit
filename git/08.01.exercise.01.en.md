* **title:** The Defense of Code Castle with the Pre-Push Guardian 🏰🛡️

**Greetings, brave defenders of Code Castle!** In the distant land of Gitlandia, Code Castle stands majestically, guarding the secrets of the art of programming. However, the forces of chaos (bugs and syntax errors) lurk, seeking to infiltrate its venerable walls. Your mission, noble guardian, is to conjure a powerful *hook* `pre-push` that protects the castle before sending your spells (codes) to the remote kingdom (remote repository). Prepare your wand and your armor, because the battle for code quality is about to begin!

#### Step 1: Preparing Your Arsenals 📜✏️

First, make sure you are within the sacred walls of your castle (your local Git repository):

```tap
cd path/to/code-castle
```

Make sure the castle is under Git protection with `git init` if necessary.

#### Step 2: Summoning the Pre-Push Guardian 🛡️

Head over to Git's secret spell vault (`.git/hooks`) and prepare your enchantment:

1. Create a new spell called `pre-push` in the `.git/hooks` directory:

```tap
cd .git/hooks
pre-push touch
chmod +x pre-push
```

2. Open the `pre-push` spell with your editing scroll (text editor) and write the following incantation to summon the guardian who will check for the presence of orcs (errors):

```tap
#!/bin/sh
# Pre-Push Guardian: Verifies that the code is free of orcs before pushing it to the remote.

# Cast the linting spell to search for orcs.
# Example: lint-my-code .

yes lint-my-code . ; so
  echo "🛡️ The guardian has found the castle free of orcs. The push can proceed."
  exit 0
the rest
  echo "🚫 The guardian has detected orcs in the castle! Correct the errors before pushing."
  output 1
fi
```

Remember to replace `lint-my-code .` with the actual command you want to run to verify your code, such as a linter or a test suite.

#### Step 3: Testing the Castle Defense 🏹

Before you send your brave spells to the remote kingdom, take a push to see the guardian in action. If your code is clean and free of orcs, the guardian will allow your push to proceed. Otherwise, you will stop, giving you a chance to correct the mistakes before compromising the castle's security.

```tap
git push main source
```

#### 🤔 Conclusion

Congratulations, noble guardian! You have successfully cast the powerful *hook* `pre-push` to protect Code Castle from the forces of chaos. With this guardian in place, you can be sure that only the purest and most worthy code will be sent to the remote kingdom, keeping the quality and security standards of the Code Castle high.
