**question** What does the `git rebase` command do?
[ ] Combines two branches without creating a new commit.
[ ] Creates a copy of a branch in another location.
[x] Changes the base of a branch, rewriting the commit history.
[ ] Deletes all commits prior to a specific point.

**question** What is a primary advantage of using `git rebase` over `git merge`?
[ ] `git rebase` automatically resolves merge conflicts.
[x] `git rebase` maintains a cleaner and more linear project history.
[ ] `git rebase` creates a merge commit to preserve the history of both branches.
[ ] `git rebase` is faster and requires fewer computational resources.

**question** What should you consider when rebasing with changes that have already been pushed to a remote repository?
[ ] `git rebase` is always preferable to `git merge` for published changes.
[x] Rebasing published changes can cause issues in the history for other users.
[ ] `git rebase` will delete your remote branch.
[ ] There are no special considerations; `git rebase` behaves the same both locally and remotely.

**question** After performing a rebase on your local branch relative to `main`, what command do you need to use to update the remote branch?
[ ] `git push origin main --force`
[x] `git push origin <your-branch-name> --force`
[ ] `git merge origin <your-branch-name>`
[ ] `git rebase origin <your-branch-name>`

**question** What is a key difference between `merge` and `rebase`?
[ ] `git merge` changes the base of a branch, while `git rebase` combines two branches.
[ ] `git merge` and `git rebase` do exactly the same thing but with different commands.
[x] `git merge` preserves the history of both branches, while `git rebase` rewrites the history to make it more linear.
[ ] `git rebase` is incapable of combining changes from two different branches.
